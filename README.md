## Troubleshooting

### If only, there is no menu

You can simply restart the Raspberry Pi.
Unplug it from the TV and back in or `ssh pi@FIND-IP-IN-1PASSWORD sudo shutdown -r now`

### If the Raspberry Pi do not start
Unplug it from the TV and plug it in via HDMI 1 to another monitor. You can also plug in a keyboard and optional a mouse. When the Pi is started, you can exit the full screen with right click and click ‚Äúexit full screen‚Äù. After that, you can start the terminal.

### Change your URL 
You can change your URL and the scaling factor in `.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`
by changing this line

```
@chromium-browser --kiosk <YOUR-URL> -force-device-scale-factor=<SCALING-FACTOR>
```
